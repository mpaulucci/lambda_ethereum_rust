# Ethereum Rust L2

The main differences between this mode and regular Ethereum Rust are:

- There is no consensus, only one sequencer proposes blocks for the network.
- Block execution is proven using a RISC-V zkVM and its proofs are sent to L1 for verification.
- A set of Solidity contracts to be deployed to the L1 are included as part of network initialization.
- Two new types of transactions are included

### Milestone 1: MVP

The network supports basic L2 functionality, allowing users to deposit and withdraw funds to join and exit the network, while also interacting with the network as they do normally on the Ethereum network (deploying contracts, sending transactions, etc).

### Milestone 2: State diffs + blobs + custom native token

The network now commits to state diffs instead of the full state, lowering the commit transactions costs and supports EIP4844.

The L2 can be deployed using a custom native token, meaning that an ERC20 can be the common currency, with fees payed in that currency.

#### Status

|           | Name          | Description                                            | Status |

### Milestone 3: Validium + Account Abstraction

The L2 can be initialized in Validium Mode, meaning the Data Availability layer is no longer the L1, but rather a DA layer of the user's choice.

The L2 supports native account abstraction following EIP 4337, allowing for custom transaction validation logic and paymaster flows.

#### Status

|           | Name          | Description                                            | Status |

TODO: Expand on account abstraction tasks.

### Milestone 4: Security (TEEs and Multi Prover support)

The L2 has added security mechanisms in place, running on Trusted Execution Environments and Multi Prover setup where multiple guarantees (Execution on TEEs, zkVMs/proving systems) are required for settlement on the L1. This better protects against possible security bugs on implementations.

#### Status

|           | Name          | Description                                            | Status |
| --------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------ |
| VM/Prover        |               | Support proving with multiple different zkVMs |   ‚ùå     |
| Contracts        |               | Support verifying multiple different zkVM executions |   ‚ùå     |
| VM        |               | Support running the operator on a TEE environment |   ‚ùå     |

## Prerequisites

- [Rust (explained in the repo's main README)](../../README.md)
- [Foundry](#foundry)

### Foundry

1. First, install `foundryup`:
    ```shell
    curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
    ```
2. Then run `foundryup`:
    ```shell
    foundryup
    ```

## How to run

### Install `ethereum_rust_l2` CLI

First of all, you need to install the `ethereum_rust_l2` CLI. You can do that by running the command below:

```
cargo install --path ../../cmd/ethereum_rust_l2
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Most of the CLI interaction needs a configuration to be set. You can set a configuration with the `config` command.

### Configure your stack

> [!TIP]
> You can create multiple configurations and switch between them.

```
ethereum_rust_l2 config create <config_name>
```

![](../../cmd/ethereum_rust_l2/assets/config_create.cast.gif)

### Initialize the stack

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Add the SPI_PROVER=mock env variable to the command (to run the prover you need ).

```
ethereum_rust_l2 stack init
```

![](../../cmd/ethereum_rust_l2/assets/stack_init.cast.gif)

### Restarting the stack

> [!WARNING]
> This command will cleanup your running L1 and L2 nodes.

```
ethereum_rust_l2 stack restart
```

## Local L1 Rich Wallets

Most of them are [here](https://github.com/ethpandaops/ethereum-package/blob/main/src/prelaunch_data_generator/genesis_constants/genesis_constants.star), but there's an extra one:

```
